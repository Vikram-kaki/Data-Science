What is Machine Learning ?

* Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 
Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data.

* Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning is a data analysis method that automates analytical model building. 
It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Types Of Machine Learning :

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

1. Supervised Learning :
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.
It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object
(typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an
inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances.
This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way.


2. Unsupervised Learning :
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of 
human supervision. In contrast to supervised learning that usually makes use of human-labeled data, unsupervised learning, also known as self-organization allows for
modeling of probability densities over inputs. It forms one of the three main categories of machine learning, along with supervised and reinforcement learning.
Semi-supervised learning, a related variant, makes use of supervised and unsupervised techniques.


3. Reinforcement Learning :
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the 
notion of cumulative reward.Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning. 
Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be 
explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).

Types of Data:

1. Labeled Data:
Labeled data is a group of samples that have been tagged with one or more labels. Labeling typically takes a set of unlabeled data and augments each piece of that
 data with meaningful tags that are informative. For example, in the case of a piece of text, this could be a sentence, paragraph, or page that has been labeled 
 with the topics mentioned in the text. Labeled data is used to train supervised machine learning algorithms. In this case, the algorithm learns from the data and 
 uses the labels to understand the expected outcome of the model.

2. Unlabeled Data:
Unlabeled data is a group of samples that do not have any labels. This type of data is used to train unsupervised machine learning algorithms. In this case, the
algorithm tries to learn the patterns in the data and group similar data points together. Unlabeled data is used to train unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
In this case, the algorithm tries to learn the patterns in the data and group similar data points together.


- Nominal data.
- Ordinal data.
- Discrete data.
- Continuous data.

1. Nominal Data:
Nominal data is a type of data that is used to label variables without providing any quantitative value. It is the simplest form of data. In this type of data,
the variables are simply names or labels. For example, the types of colors, types of fruits, etc. Nominal data is also known as categorical data.

2. Ordinal Data:
Ordinal data is a type of data that is used to label variables in such a way that the values can be sorted. It is the second level of measurement. In ordinal data,
the variables are labels that can be ordered or ranked. For example, a Likert scale (e.g., a 7-point scale from “strongly agree” through to “strongly disagree”).

3. Discrete Data:
Discrete data is a type of data that consists of whole numbers or counts. It is a type of data that is counted. In this type of data, the values are distinct and 
separate. For example, the number of students in a class (e.g., 30 students), the number of cars in a parking lot, etc.

4. Continuous Data:
Continuous data is a type of data that consists of an infinite number of possible values. It is a type of data that is measured. In this type of data, the values
can be measured and can take any value within a range. For example, the height of a person (e.g., 6 feet), the weight of a person, etc.
