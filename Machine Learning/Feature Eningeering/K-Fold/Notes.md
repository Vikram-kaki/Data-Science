# K-Fold Cross-Validation

K-fold cross-validation is a popular technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model. It helps to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

## How it works

1. Split the dataset into k equal-sized folds.
2. For each fold, use it as the validation set and the remaining folds as the training set.
3. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the validation set.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 k times, each time using a different fold as the validation set.
5. Calculate the average performance metrics across all iterations.

## Advantages of K-Fold Cross-Validation

- Provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance by averaging across multiple iterations.
- Helps to reduce the impact of data variability and overfitting.
- Allows for better comparison of different models or hyperparameter settings.

## Conclusion

K-fold cross-validation is a valuable technique in machine learning for evaluating model performance. It provides a more reliable estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data and helps in making informed decisions during the model development process.
