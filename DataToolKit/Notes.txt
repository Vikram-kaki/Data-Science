Os - It's the intermediate between the software and hardware of the computer.


The Operating System lies in the category of system software. It basically manages all the resources of the computer. An
operating system acts as an interface between the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware.
The operating system is designed in such a way that it can manage the overall resources and operations of the computer.
It is a fully integrated set of specialized programs that handle all the operations of the computer. It controls and
monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, which also includes application programs and
other system software of the computer. Examples of the operating system are Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.

Objectives:

Let us now see some objectives of the operating system, which are:

Convenient to use: One of the objectives is to make the computer system more convenient to use in an efficient manner.
User Friendly: To make the computer system more interactive with a more convenient interface for the users.
To provide easy access to users for using resources by acting as an intermediary between the hardware and its users.
For managing the resources of a computer.
Controls and Monitoring: By keeping track of who is using which resource, granting resource requests, and mediating
conflicting requests from different programs and users.
Providing efficient and fair sharing of resources between the users and programs.
Characteristics:

Let us now discuss some of the important characteristic features of operating systems:

Device Management: The operating system keeps track of all the devices. So, it is also called the Input / Output
controller that decides which process gets the device, when, and for how much time.
File Management: It allocates and de-allocates the resources and also decides who gets the resource.
Job Accounting: It keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs or users.
Error-detecting Aids: It contains methods that include the production of dumps, traces, error messages, and other
debugging and error-detecting methods.
Memory Management: It keeps track of the primary memory, like what part of it is i

N use by whom, or what part is not in use, etc. and It also allocates the memory when a process or program requests it.
Processor Management: It allocates the processor to a process and then de-allocates the processor when it is no longer
required or the job is done.
Control on System Performance: It records the delays between the request for a service and from the system.
Security: It prevents unauthorized access to programs and data by means of passwords or some kind of protection technique.
